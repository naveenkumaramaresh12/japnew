                                    JAP-PCL is created as a multi-state farmer producer company, started with shareholder-member farmers from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. All these farmers practice only organic farming or natural farming, and hence the name, jaivik (organic) and pratrutik (natural). 

<br></br><br></br>These organic farmers have been certified since 2015.  Later the new PCL was joined by small holders certified groups (ICS groups – Internal Control Systems) from different districts/locations from the 4 states, thus giving a wider basket of offering for FPOs to connect to markets and buyers. Within a year the PCL has 24 farmer-members, representing 1751 certified organic farmers. It also did a business of INR 118 million in the financial year 2022-23. 

<br></br><br></br>The formation of JAP-PCL and connecting it to buyers and markets are powered and facilitated by ICCOA – International Competence Centre for Organic Agriculture as part of its strategy to incubate a farmer - producer company to maintain and carry forward the sustainable farming status and organic certification of farmer groups created by ICCOA’s projects during the last ten years or so.

                             <h3>What We Do?</h3>
                             <p>    We represent 1751 farmers in 14 groups, all ‘certified organic’, managed through ICS (Internal Control System) and registered with APEDA accredited Organic Certification Body as per NPOP/EU and/or NOP organic standard. JAP-PCL started business in 2022 by marketing fruits and vegetables produced by its farmers from the 14 groups in the markets of Bangalore. And soon after, it started bulk procurement and supplying organic red chilli, turmeric etc. to exporters (under category A). 

<br></br><br></br>By next year or two, the producer company plan to establish a processing unit to enable value-addition of farmer producers closest to the site of production, and thereby help these farmers get the lion’s share of market value; as well as offer organic high-quality products to its buyers/markets. 
				
<br></br><br></br>In its first year of operations JAP reached a turnover of INR.118 million (USD. 1.5 million) largely with organic red chillies, fruits & vegetables. 

<br></br><br></br>The company, today is procuring and supplying products to domestic companies in bulk; and looking forward to start retail packing and to enter international markets (exports) as well.   

<br></br><br></br>JAP PCL targets to cross Rs.500 million in the FY 2024-25.   </p>
